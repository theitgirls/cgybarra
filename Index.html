            Hello classmates! My name is Christian Ybarra and I am a rising senior at O'Connor High School in Helotes, TX. 
            Although I am not a female, I thought this course would be a good stepping stone for my engineering career. 
            I really find medical technology, and helping others very interesting. At the time of writing this, I am in my Boimed Engineering class working with my team to develop a wheelchair with heat therapy inside. 
            Outside of school I like to do physical activities like rock climbing and ocassionally go on nightime runs. 
            I am a huge fan of Mavel movies, comedies, as well as horror movies. I have 3 dogs, Winston is a Golden Retriever, Arabella is a Poodle, and Brownie is a Shih Tzu. 
            I look forward to making new friends in this class!
