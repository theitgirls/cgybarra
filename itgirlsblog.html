        <h2>Story Telling Chart</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 26th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            I chose this compelling chart because it has a lot of data.
            The chart proves that vaccines help us in our society. Eventually, 
            there will be more than 2 million lives saved. Vaccines help prevent us 
            from diseases and have advanced over the years making them more efficient.

        <h2>Bias or Bust</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 25th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            In this Blog we will talk about what "Bias" is. Bias is a favored view
            of an idea or thing. For example, some can say they are biased against 
            pineapple on pizza. There are different types of bias. There is Informed Bias, 
            Conformity Bias, and Conformation Bias. Not all Bias opinions are bad, but they 
            may not be good as well. In the activity, we used sources to convince why our 
            opinnion was the best. For example, we would choose to eat the cow over the horse
            because we know so little of the horse anatomy and what is actually edible, whereas the cow,
            almost every part of it can be eaten.

        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 22nd, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the art of protecting newtworks, devices, critical systems,
            and sensetive information. During our speakers presentation, she talked
            about one of the biggest threats, phishing. Phishing is a cybercrime
            where victims are lured in by emails, text messages, or even phone calls.
            Eventually there will be new threats we will not foresee, but eventually
            we will be able to overcome it.

        <h2>Node Code Breakers (Citizen Science)</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 21st, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Node Code Breakers is a community study for patients with breast cancer. The main goal in this study is to find the pattern
            of germinal centers in lymph nodes. If nodes are seen, it indicates the patient has an active immune system therefor
            meaning that the patient has a better chance of a positive prognosis. This technology we use in this experiment can help
            so many future patients who may have the same patterns seen. Which means if cancer is present, it can either be removed,
            or be put straight into remission.

        <h2>Inside the Lab</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today during my scavenger hunt, I visited the 3D printing Lab.
            I met with Trever to discuss the technology he uses for the students that come to him to make prints.
            Although some prints were slow, they were efficient. Many of the printers he uses are base priced printers,
            however he does have some high end printers that do the job very well. Overall it was a great 
            experience and i loved seeing the machines work.

        <h2>Autobiography of Elizabeth Friedman</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
           Elizabeth Friedman was born August 26, 1892. Not only was she a mother, wife, and writer, but she was
           also â€œAmericas first female cryptanalyst. In 1921 Friedman and her husband moved to DC to work in the
           War Department where Elizabeth was later employed as a cryptanalyst for the Navy. Mrs. Friedmans
           main accomplishments were deciphering enemy codes in both World Wars and helped against
           international drug runners and smuggling cases during the Prohibition.

        <h3>Teachable Machine BLOG</h3>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            For my Teachable Machine assignment, my partner Wendy and I decided to use sound recognition. We used
            our background noise as our classmates discussing with each other. For our "class 2 and 3 sample", we used 
            YouTube to collect audio of people in distress and people laughing to distingush the difference.
            Overall, we found out that we need lots more data to really tell the difference in the way people sound.
            Lastly, AI has many benefits especially for everyday civillians. Although we are not there yet, I believe
            that one day AI will help us create an instant diagnosis and cure to deadly diseases/viruses.
