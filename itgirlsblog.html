        <h2>Inside the Lab</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 20th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            Today during my scavenger hunt, I visited the 3D printing Lab.
            I met with Trever to discuss the technology he uses for the students that come to him to make prints.
            Although some prints were slow, they were efficient. Many of the printers he uses are base priced printers,
            however he does have some high end printers that do the job very well. Overall it was a great 
            experience and i loved seeing the machines work.

        <h2>Autobiography of Elizabeth Friedman</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
           Elizabeth Friedman was born August 26, 1892. Not only was she a mother, wife, and writer, but she was
           also â€œAmericas first female cryptanalyst. In 1921 Friedman and her husband moved to DC to work in the
           War Department where Elizabeth was later employed as a cryptanalyst for the Navy. Mrs. Friedmans
           main accomplishments were deciphering enemy codes in both World Wars and helped against
           international drug runners and smuggling cases during the Prohibition.

        <h3>Teachable Machine BLOG</h3>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            For my Teachable Machine assignment, my partner Wendy and I decided to use sound recognition. We used
            our background noise as our classmates discussing with each other. For our "class 2 and 3 sample", we used 
            YouTube to collect audio of people in distress and people laughing to distingush the difference.
            Overall, we found out that we need lots more data to really tell the difference in the way people sound.
            Lastly, AI has many benefits especially for everyday civillians. Although we are not there yet, I believe
            that one day AI will help us create an instant diagnosis and cure to deadly diseases/viruses.
