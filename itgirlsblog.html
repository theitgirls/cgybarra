        <h2>The Power of Technology</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra's IT Girls BLOG</p>
        <p>
            Today in modern society we are on the verge of having brain powered technology.
            Researchers are trying to find ways to use EEG to power a wheelchair.
            I believe one day our technology will be so advanced that we wont need to use our
            bodies to make motions or do simple tasks.

        <h2>Autobiography of Elizabeth Friedman</h2>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
           Elizabeth Friedman was born August 26, 1892. Not only was she a mother, wife, and writer, but she was
           also â€œAmericas first female cryptanalyst. In 1921 Friedman and her husband moved to DC to work in the
           War Department where Elizabeth was later employed as a cryptanalyst for the Navy. Mrs. Friedmans
           main accomplishments were deciphering enemy codes in both World Wars and helped against
           international drug runners and smuggling cases during the Prohibition.

        <h3>Teachable Machine BLOG</h3>
        <p>Christian Ybarra / July 19th, 2022</p>
        <p>
            For my Teachable Machine assignment, my partner Wendy and I decided to use sound recognition. We used
            our background noise as our classmates discussing with each other. For our "class 2 and 3 sample", we used 
            YouTube to collect audio of people in distress and people laughing to distingush the difference.
            Overall, we found out that we need lots more data to really tell the difference in the way people sound.
            Lastly, AI has many benefits especially for everyday civillians. Although we are not there yet, I believe
            that one day AI will help us create an instant diagnosis and cure to deadly diseases/viruses.
